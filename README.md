Hello.rb - random shit, (mostly) guessing syntax

numGuess.rb - Number guesser game (1 - 100)

toDo.rb - basic to do list

numbers.rb - a program that takes a bunch of inputs and does maths <sup>it just takes and multiplies user given numbers by an increasing increment for a user defined number of times - its pretty fun to watch tbh</sup>
